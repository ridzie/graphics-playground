Tasks:
Programming
Set up a basic WebGL program, which initializes the drawing window. Draw a simple triangle. (This will not be checked for plagiarism, feel free use code you find on the internet, however make sure you understand it)
- index.html + main.js 

Administrative
Provide proof that you have a copy (physical or digital) of the required book (Please do not submit the entire book, just cite a paragraph of you liking, Chapter + Page)

Chapter 1
Graphics Systems and Models: 1.2.3 Output Devices: Page 8: on CRT monitors
A typical CRT will emit light for only a short time—usually, a few milliseconds— after the phosphor is excited by the electron beam. For a human to see a steady, flicker-free image on most CRT displays, the same path must be retraced, or re- freshed, by the beam at a sufficiently high rate, the refresh rate. In older systems, the refresh rate is determined by the frequency of the power system, 60 cycles per sec- ond or 60 hertz (Hz) in the United States and 50 Hz in much of the rest of the world. Modern displays are no longer coupled to these low frequencies and operate at rates up to about 85 Hz.

Honestly, i've had a 6 year break from coding so most of the tutorials i went through online (text and video) did not immediately make sense to me. After going through youtube tutorials and the resource links on the assignment page, i mostly relied on ChatGPT to set up the basic JS for me, and then i went line by line into the code, requesting explainations for anything i didnt fully understand. i then played around with the parameters to see if i understood enough to not break anything. 
i then found this https://indigocode.dev/tutorials/webgl/01-hello-triangle and it felt pretty neat, the only issue i can think of for this was that it assumed JS knowledge instead of linking to resources (which is understandable). I went back and fed a lot of keywords and functions used into chatgpt to get a description of what they were and how they are used.
